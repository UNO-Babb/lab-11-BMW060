I adjusted the following:

- set the time between shoppers arriving to be between 1 and 3 minutes
    This gave slightly more random data in the end
- added the data processing for the max wait time
    This gave a deeper insight to how long people have to wait
- adjusted the number of items to 5-25, with 15-15 items showing up twice as much as 5-15
    This gave longer line times and (i feel like) a more realistic shopping experience
** I ended up leaving the number of checkers as 2 after messing with it a bit **

While this simulation didn't help me understand grocery stores too much more,
it did get me interested in the simulation element of python and made me more interested in the 
upcoming gomework project. I'm curious to see how we'll be able to include multiple different aspects,
such as multiple traffic lights.
